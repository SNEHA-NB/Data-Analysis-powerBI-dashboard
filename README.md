I developed the comprehensive project in power BI, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

# HR Data-Analytics(Interactive Dashboard creating using PowerBI)

## Project Objective
- Help an organization to improve employee performance and improve employee retention(reduced attrition) by creating HR Analytics dashboard.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/SNEHA-NB/Data-Analysis-powerBI-dashboard/blob/main/HR%20Analytics%20dashboard.pbit"> Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- How many employees are currently working in the company?
- How many employees have left the company?
- What is the overall attrition rate?
- What is the average age of employees?
- What is the average income per year?
- What is the average tenure (years at company)?
- Which education fields have the highest attrition?
- Which age group shows the highest attrition rate?
- Is attrition higher among males or females?
- Which salary range sees the most attrition?
- Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
- At what point in an employee's tenure is attrition highest?
- What is the job satisfaction score distribution by role?
- Are new hires (0–1 years) more likely to leave?
- What percentage of employees with high job satisfaction still leave?

## Process
- To create the HR Analytics Dashboard, first collect key employee data such as Age, Gender, Department, Job Role, Income, Tenure, Attrition status, and Job Satisfaction. Clean the data by removing duplicates, correcting types, and creating columns like Age Groups and Salary Slabs. Build a simple data model and create essential DAX measures for KPIs like Employee Count, Attrition Rate, Average Age, and Average Salary.

- Design the dashboard using KPI cards for high-level metrics and visuals like pie charts (Attrition by Education), bar charts (Attrition by Age and Salary), a treemap (Attrition by Gender), and a matrix (Job Satisfaction by Role). Add slicers for Department, Gender, and Age Group to allow dynamic filtering. Finally, format the visuals for clarity, validate the calculations, and publish the dashboard with scheduled data refreshes.

## Project Insight
- The HR Analytics Dashboard highlights that the company has a 16.1% attrition rate, with the highest attrition among employees aged 26-35 years. Most employees leaving are from Life Sciences and Medical education fields and within the lower salary range (up to $5K). Male employees have a slightly higher attrition rate compared to females.

- Attrition is particularly high among Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives, and employees are most likely to leave within their first year at the company. Job satisfaction scores vary by role, suggesting a link between satisfaction and turnover.

## Final Conclusion:
The HR Analytics Dashboard reveals that attrition is a significant challenge, particularly among younger employees (26–35 years), lower-income groups, and specific job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives. Early tenure (first year) shows the highest risk of resignation, indicating a need to strengthen onboarding and early engagement strategies.

To improve retention, the company should focus on targeted support for high-risk roles, review salary structures for lower bands, and enhance job satisfaction initiatives. Strategic action based on these insights can lead to a stronger, more stable workforce and reduced employee turnover.
